            <h2>Hey, I'm Adrian.</h2>

                <p>I'm a freelance front-end web designer/developer, stationed in (read: near) <span>Detroit, Michigan</span>, looking to make this ol' World Wide Web my canvas. I believe in hand-crafted code, responsive design, accessibility, and intuitive user-interfaces. I write my HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery code from the bottom up, but can find my way home in a CMS or framework setting as well.</p>
                <div class='imgPH'></div>
                <p>I'm also a graduate student of Information Management &amp; User-Experience at Wayne State University's School of Library of Information Science, and my day job is as a reference intern at a gorgeous public library. I'm a strong supporter of information literacy and transparency, cultural preservation, and libraries for the "future." Metadata is fun, digital curation is fun, helping people is very fun.</p>
                <div class='imgPH'></div>
                <p>I'm very into words. Writing has been a mainstay in my life since I first picked up a rock and etched my feelings into it. I'm educated as a historian, and have experience writing almost every type of style there is. There are a lot of words in my head, and I'm loving every chance I get to use them. If editing is your thing, I've been around MLA, APA, and Chicago style guides for a while.</p>
                <div class='imgPH'></div>
                <p>Do you like photography? I do too. I've been taking pictures since 2007, and even freelanced for a bit during my undergrad. I have experience with event, portrait, and commercial photography, and I find the sound of the shutter very relaxing. Adobe products have been my friend for a few now, and I'm very proficient with Adobe Bridge, Photoshop CS6, and Illustrator CS6.</p>

                <p>You may find me playing hockey or disc golf, reading or playing Magic: The Gathering. I love history, philosophy, and space. I also love my two monster pugs and my little rescued cat, my Starbucks Gold Card, The Inbetweeners, 70s soft rock, and trying to be the happiest person I can possibly be.</p>
